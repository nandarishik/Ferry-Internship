This model gave me a realistic accuracy of **69%** and, more importantly, a crucial insight—medication adherence was driven by human factors like **health literacy**, **social support**, and **trust in the provider**.\n","\n","However, I hit a wall. Both advanced algorithms (like XGBoost) and extensive tuning (`GridSearchCV`) failed to improve that 69% score. My model was good, but it couldn't get any better. This told me that the limitation wasn't the model's engine, but the fuel—the features themselves.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## **The Breakthrough: A New Hypothesis**\n","\n","Instead of adding more general features (which had previously failed), I formed a new, targeted hypothesis: **What if I could create better features by combining and refining the signals from the predictors I already knew were the most powerful?**\n","\n","This led me to create two new, highly effective features.\n","\n","### **Feature 1: The `patient_readiness_score`**\n","\n","* **The Story:** I knew that a patient's understanding (`health_literacy_score`), their personal conviction (`belief_in_medication`), their support system (`social_support_index`), and their trust in their doctor (`provider_consistency`) were the four most important factors. I theorized that these individual traits could be combined into a single, powerful metric representing a patient's overall preparedness to succeed with their treatment.\n","* **How I Did It:** I created a composite \"readiness\" score. To do this fairly, I first scaled the numeric features so they were on the same level, then added them together with the score for `provider_consistency`. This new feature provided the model with a concentrated, high-level summary of a patient's psychosocial state, making the key patterns much easier to detect.\n","\n","### **Feature 2: The `literacy_x_income` Interaction**\n","\n","* **The Story:** I hypothesized that the challenges of low health literacy are often amplified by having a low income. A patient might struggle to understand complex instructions, but that struggle becomes a critical barrier if they also can't afford transportation for follow-up questions or co-pays for simpler medication alternatives.\n","* **How I Did It:** I created an interaction feature that multiplied a patient's `health_literacy_score` by their `income_bracket`. This didn't just tell the model if a patient had low literacy *or* low income; it explicitly highlighted the compounded risk when a patient had **both**. This allowed the model to learn a more nuanced, real-world pattern.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## **Inference**\n","\n","When I trained my model with this new, refined set of features, the results were definitive.\n","\n","* **The Performance Jump:** The model's accuracy **broke through the plateau, rising to 72%**.\n","* **A More Balanced Model:** Crucially, the model became better balanced. It maintained its excellent ability to identify adherent patients (81% recall) while significantly improving its ability to correctly identify at-risk, non-adherent patients (61% recall).\n","\n","The final story is clear: my initial model was right about *what* mattered. But by intelligently engineering features that captured the *relationships between* those key factors, I built a more nuanced and powerful model. This journey proves that the most successful data science projects often rely not just on powerful algorithms, but on a deep understanding of the problem to guide the creation of truly meaningful features.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"tGJSBvgnOHhb"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["*****TESTING*****"],"metadata":{"id":"iUrtMVquOezz"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Define the new patient data as a list of dictionaries\n","new_patients_data = [\n","    {\n","        # Case 1: High-Risk Patient (Saanvi)\n","        'age': 68, 'gender': 'Female', 'education_level': 'Secondary', 'income_bracket': 'Low',\n","        'location_type': 'Rural', 'hemoglobin_level': 10.2, 'iron_deficiency_status': True,\n","        'comorbidities_count': 3, 'lab_test_frequency': 1, 'side_effects_reported': True,\n","        'medication_type': 'Iron Tablets', 'dosage_frequency': 'Daily', 'prescription_duration_days': 60,\n","        'tablets_dispensed': 60, 'pill_count_last_visit': 10, 'refill_gap_days': 15,\n","        'health_literacy_score': 0.3, 'depression_score': 2.5, 'social_support_index': 1.5,\n","        'belief_in_medication': 0.4, 'distance_to_clinic_km': 25, 'insurance_status': False,\n","        'medication_cost_inr': 350, 'provider_consistency': False,\n","        'name': 'Saanvi (High Risk)'\n","    },\n","    {\n","        # Case 2: Low-Risk Patient (Rohan)\n","        'age': 35, 'gender': 'Male', 'education_level': 'Postgraduate', 'income_bracket': 'High',\n","        'location_type': 'Urban', 'hemoglobin_level': 13.5, 'iron_deficiency_status': False,\n","        'comorbidities_count': 0, 'lab_test_frequency': 4, 'side_effects_reported': False,\n","        'medication_type': 'Oral Supplements', 'dosage_frequency': 'Daily', 'prescription_duration_days': 30,\n","        'tablets_dispensed': 30, 'pill_count_last_visit': 2, 'refill_gap_days': 1,\n","        'health_literacy_score': 0.95, 'depression_score': 0.5, 'social_support_index': 4.5,\n","        'belief_in_medication': 0.9, 'distance_to_clinic_km': 5, 'insurance_status': True,\n","        'medication_cost_inr': 200, 'provider_consistency': True,\n","        'name': 'Rohan (Low Risk)'\n","    },\n","    {\n","        # Case 3: Ambiguous Patient (Priya)\n","        'age': 45, 'gender': 'Female', 'education_level': 'Graduate', 'income_bracket': 'Medium',\n","        'location_type': 'Urban', 'hemoglobin_level': 11.0, 'iron_deficiency_status': True,\n","        'comorbidities_count': 1, 'lab_test_frequency': 2, 'side_effects_reported': True,\n","        'medication_type': 'Injections', 'dosage_frequency': 'Weekly', 'prescription_duration_days': 90,\n","        'tablets_dispensed': 12, 'pill_count_last_visit': 5, 'refill_gap_days': 8,\n","        'health_literacy_score': 0.8, 'depression_score': 1.8, 'social_support_index': 2.5,\n","        'belief_in_medication': 0.6, 'distance_to_clinic_km': 12, 'insurance_status': True,\n","        'medication_cost_inr': 450, 'provider_consistency': True,\n","        'name': 'Priya (Ambiguous)'\n","    }\n","]\n","\n","# Create a DataFrame\n","test_cases_df = pd.DataFrame(new_patients_data)"],"metadata":{"id":"kjSmyf1bNScZ","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1759122423085,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":48,"user":{"displayName":"Nanda Rishik","userId":"02796979058055990221"}}},"execution_count":6,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Create a copy to avoid changing the original test cases\n","processed_cases = test_cases_df.copy()\n","\n","# --- Feature Engineering ---\n","# 1. \"Patient Readiness\" Score (using the SAME scaler fitted on the training data)\n","readiness_features = processed_cases[['health_literacy_score', 'social_support_index', 'belief_in_medication']]\n","scaled_features = scaler.transform(readiness_features) # Use .transform(), NOT .fit_transform()\n","processed_cases['patient_readiness_score'] = (\n","    scaled_features[:, 0] + scaled_features[:, 1] + scaled_features[:, 2] +\n","    processed_cases['provider_consistency'].astype(int)\n",")\n","\n","# 2. \"Literacy & Income\" Interaction\n","income_numeric_map = {'Low': 1, 'Medium': 2, 'High': 3}\n","processed_cases['income_numeric'] = processed_cases['income_bracket'].map(income_numeric_map)\n","processed_cases['literacy_x_income'] = processed_cases['health_literacy_score'] * processed_cases['income_numeric']\n","\n","# --- Final Preprocessing ---\n","# 1.

This is a perfect demonstration of its capabilities.\n","\n","***\n","## Saanvi (High Risk): A Clear Negative\n","* **Prediction:** Not Adherent (with 76.5% confidence)\n","* **Analysis:** The model correctly and confidently identified Saanvi as a high-risk patient. Her combination of low health literacy, low social support, low income, and provider inconsistency were powerful negative signals that the model learned to associate with non-adherence. This is a clear success.\n","\n","***\n","## Rohan (Low Risk): A Clear Positive\n","* **Prediction:** Adherent (with 77.6% confidence)\n","* **Analysis:** As expected, the model confidently classified Rohan as very likely to be adherent. His strong positive attributes—high literacy, great social support, provider consistency—created a high `patient_readiness_score`, which the model correctly interpreted as a strong indicator of success.\n","\n","***\n","## Priya (Ambiguous): The Nuanced Verdict\n","* **Prediction:** Adherent (but with only 56.4% confidence)\n","* **Analysis:** This is the most impressive result. The model's final prediction is \"Adherent,\" suggesting her positive traits (good literacy, provider consistency) ultimately outweighed her negative ones (side effects, higher depression score). However, the **low confidence** is the key insight. The model is essentially telling us: *\"My best guess is that she will be adherent, but I am not very sure. There are significant risk factors here.\"*\n","\n","In a real-world clinical setting, this low confidence score is incredibly valuable. It acts as a flag for healthcare providers, indicating that Priya is a \"borderline\" case who needs extra monitoring and support, even if the final prediction is positive.\n","\n","This confirms that our final model doesn't just make black-and-white decisions; it understands nuance and uncertainty, which is the hallmark of a truly effective predictive tool.
