Our attempts to create complex, \"smarter\" features actually added more noise than signal. The model struggled to find a clear pattern in these highly abstract features (`treatment_complexity`, `age_squared`, etc.) and its ability to generalize to new data got worse.\n","\n","Most importantly, the **recall for non-adherent patients (Class 0) dropped to 0.48**. This means the model is now missing more than half of the at-risk patients you would want to help, making it the least useful model we've built for any practical purpose.\n","\n","---\n","## Final Verdict and Project Recommendation\n","We have now completed the full data science lifecycle. We started with a broken model, fixed it, established a strong baseline, and ran multiple experiments to improve it. The data has given us a clear answer.\n","\n","**Your best model is the first one we properly tuned, before any feature engineering was attempted.**\n","\n","That model is the winner because it:\n","1.  Achieved the highest and most stable accuracy (**69%**).\n","2.  Had the most **balanced performance** for identifying both adherent and non-adherent patients.\n","3.  Relied on the original, most **interpretable features**, leading to clear, actionable insights (like the importance of health literacy).\n","\n","Congratulations, Nanda! You've successfully taken a complex problem from a flawed starting point to a robust, well-understood, and realistic conclusion. You now have a reliable baseline model and, more importantly, a data-driven reason to trust that a simpler approach is the most effective one for this problem."],"metadata":{"id":"XaLMZeriMjY_"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"kdvxlKqkMORy"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
