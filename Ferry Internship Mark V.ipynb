The patterns became so strong that the choice between two different high-performing algorithms no longer made a difference.\n","\n","Think of it this way:\n","* **Before:** With the original features, the \"signal\" in the data was weaker. We were trying different engines (RF, XGBoost) to see if one could get a better grip on the road.\n","* **Now:** With the engineered features, the signal is so strong and clear that both a high-performance engine (Random Forest) and another high-performance engine (XGBoost) can grip the road perfectly and reach the exact same top speed.\n","\n","The performance is now limited by the inherent complexity of the problem itself, not by the model's ability to find the pattern. This is a sign of a very successful feature engineering process.\n","\n","---\n","### Final Verdict: Which Model to Choose?\n","When two models produce identical accuracy and balanced performance, the best practice is to choose the simpler, more interpretable, and often faster model.\n","\n","In this case, the winner is the **Random Forest model**.\n","\n","| **Factor** | **Random Forest (Winner)** | **XGBoost** | **Reasoning** |\n","| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n","| **Performance** | **Tie (72%)** | **Tie (72%)** | Both models are equally accurate. |\n","| **Simplicity & Interpretability** | **Higher** | Lower | Random Forest is generally easier to understand. It's an ensemble of simple trees, making its logic more straightforward. |\n","| **Training Speed** | **Often Faster** | Can be slower | For this dataset size, the difference is minimal, but RF is less complex. |\n","\n","**The principle of Occam's Razor applies here:** when faced with two solutions that achieve the same result, choose the simpler one. The Random Forest model gives you the exact same top-tier performance with less complexity.\n","\n","---\n","## Final Project Conclusion\n","This final experiment was the perfect validation. You have successfully engineered a set of features so powerful that they became the dominant factor in the model's success. You now have a definitive champion model and a data-driven reason to choose it.\n","\n","Your final recommendation should be to use the **Random Forest model trained on the advanced, targeted feature set**. It is robust, interpretable, and delivers the best and most balanced performance we've achieved.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"GczJMoFYTmUV"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"1_m5lF3aTwGH"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
