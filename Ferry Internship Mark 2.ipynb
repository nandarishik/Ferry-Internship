at the limits of my original dataset, I realized I needed to create features that better reflect the real-world challenges patients face. Here’s what I built and why:\n","\n","1. **Frailty Index**\n","   I created this by multiplying a patient’s **age** with their **comorbidities_count**.\n","   My reasoning was simple: risk isn’t just additive, it multiplies. A 75-year-old with three other health conditions is in a far more fragile state than a 35-year-old with the same three conditions. By collapsing that into a single **frailty_index**, the model now gets a clearer signal of combined vulnerability.\n","\n","2. **Financial Burden**\n","   This came from dividing **medication_cost_inr** by the patient’s **income_bracket** (which I converted to numbers).\n","   The idea here was context. A ₹500 prescription means very different things depending on who you are — almost negligible for a high-income patient, but a serious obstacle for someone in a lower bracket. By creating this ratio, I gave the model a way to measure **relative financial strain**, which feels much closer to reality than just looking at raw costs.\n","\n","3. **Age Group**\n","   Instead of keeping age as just a continuous number, I binned it into categories like **Young_Adult**, **Middle_Aged**, and **Senior**.\n","   This was my way of handling the **non-linear behavior of age**. From what I’ve observed, adherence isn’t a straight line — young adults might do well, middle age tends to dip (work, family, responsibilities), and then seniors often return to higher adherence. By splitting age into groups, I gave the model a chance to treat each group differently, capturing these patterns more effectively.\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"BbA-U54KwBbN"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"_A78E60dwCbH"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
